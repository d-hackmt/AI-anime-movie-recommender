# 🎬 AI-Powered Anime Movie Recommender
### *Evaluation & Observability at Scale*

Welcome to the **AI-Powered Anime Movie Recommender**! This isn't just another recommendation engine; it’s a full-stack LLM application built with a focus on **reliability**, **observability**, and **scientific evaluation**.

---

## 🚀 The Vision
Finding the next anime to binge shouldn't feel like a chore. Our system leverages Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to understand your preferences deeply and suggest titles from a curated database, while ensuring every recommendation is backed by data and tracked for quality.

## 📐 System Architecture

Our RAG-based architecture ensures that recommendations are grounded in actual anime data, preventing "hallucinations" and providing relevant context.

## 🏗️ Deployment & Infrastructure

We follow a professional **Development to Production** workflow, moving from local environments to a robust cloud infrastructure on GCP.

### 🏠 Local Development
Running locally is straightforward:
1.  **Environment**: Python 3.10+
2.  **Run**: `streamlit run app/main.py`
3.  **Docker**: `docker build -t anime-recommender .`

### ☁️ Cloud Production (GCP + K8s)
Our production environment is hosted on **Google Cloud Platform** using a containerized approach managed by **Kubernetes**.

```mermaid
graph LR
    subgraph Local Dev
        Code[Source Code] --> Docker[Docker Image]
    end

    subgraph Google Cloud Platform
        VM[GCP Compute Engine VM]
        
        subgraph Kubernetes Cluster
            Docker -.-> K8s[Minikube / K8s Pods]
            K8s --> Service[K8s Service]
        end
    end

    subgraph Monitoring Edge
        K8s -.-> Grafana[Grafana Cloud]
        K8s -.-> LangSmith[LangSmith]
    end

    User((User)) --> Service
```

-   **Orchestration**: We use **Minikube** inside a GCP VM to manage our Kubernetes pods, ensuring high availability and scalability.
-   **Security**: API keys and tokens are managed via **Kubernetes Secrets**.
-   **Observability**: Real-time cluster metrics are streamed to **Grafana Cloud** for deep infrastructure monitoring.

## 🧪 Evaluation Workflow

We believe in **"What gets measured, gets improved."** Our evaluation pipeline runs systematically to ensure the AI's logic remains sharp.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant D as Dataset (Golden Sets)
    participant A as AI Recommender
    participant LS as LangSmith (Evaluation)
    participant E as Expert Reviewer (LLM-as-a-Judge)

    D->>A: Sample Query
    A->>LS: Trace & Prediction
    LS->>E: Compare Pred vs Ground Truth
    E->>LS: Quality Score (0-1)
    LS->>D: Update Performance Metrics
```

## 🔍 Why LangSmith? (The "Magic" Mirror)

Building with LLMs can often feel like working inside a dark room. You send a prompt, and a response comes back—but *why*? 

**LangSmith** is our high-powered flashlight. We use it for:
1.  **Debugging the Black Box**: See every step of the chain, from the raw prompt to the retrieved documents.
2.  **Performance Metrics**: Track latency, token usage, and cost in real-time.
3.  **Regression Testing**: When we change a prompt, LangSmith tells us immediately if the quality dropped or improved.
4.  **Dataset Management**: Turn problematic user queries into test cases with a single click.

*Without observability, you're just guessing. With LangSmith, you're engineering.*
